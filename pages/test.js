            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
            meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream;
            <p>
              and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
              noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the
              stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
              of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the
              Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that
              universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us
              in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness
              overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul
              and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I
              often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these
              conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full
              and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my
              soul is the mirror of the infinite God!

              The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The
              crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I
              heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people
              towards Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of
              movement from the pit.

            <p>
              It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I
              suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore
              confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent
              movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to
              gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder
              remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would
              advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did
              so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit
              in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards
              the pit.
